Provide NextGen SSO Security Solution, Simplify SSO Integrations, and Make SSO Affordable to the World.

We Started Because We Wanted to Provide An Affordable and Advanced SSO Solution to the World

We began our Identity and Access Management - IAM journey implementing Single Sign On Solutions. Through this journey, we discovered multiple problems with SSO implementations. Small and medium businesses can't afford Enterprise SSO Software licenses, SSO Implementation cycles are long and complex, and one SSO solution does not integrate with all applications. SSO is still a nice-to-have for many businesses today, until the day comes when critical applications are compromised or financial data is stolen. Businesses often experience serious security incidents.

We started building a perfect SSO solution with these challenges in mind. Our NexGen SSO Solution is built on future technologies. SSOgen is affordable for small businesses with 50 users as well as big enterprises with 10 millions users in ERP Systems. SSOgen greatly simplifies SSO Integrations with applications. A typical SSO Implementation cycle is less than a day. SSOgen offers the most secure Multi Factor Authentication for free. Yet, SSOgen is a flexible SSO Gateway solution that integrates with third party SSO solutions to close any SSO Integration gaps.
