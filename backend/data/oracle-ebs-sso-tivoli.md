Oracle EBS - IBM Tivoli Access Manager TAM SSO Integration

IBM Tivoli Access Manager and Oracle EBS SSO Integration

Oracle EBS and IBM Tivoli Access Manager - TAM can be integrated for Single Sign On through SSOGEN Gateway. Historically, Tivoli Access Manager was integrated with Oracle 10g Application Server - OSSO 10g. EBS 11i and 12.1 had been integrated with Oracle 10g Application Server. Now that OSSO 10g had been retired, the challenge of Integrating Tivoli Access Manager with Oracle EBS raises.

SSOgen would act as a gateway between TAM and Oracle EBS. TAM WebSeal would be installed on SSOgen servers and EBS would be SSO registered with SSOgen. SSOgen would read Tivoli SSO Session, and iv-user user token and seamlessly integrate with Oracle EBS to complete the Single Sign On Login Process.

Oracle Access Manager - OAM and Oracle Internet Directory - OID is the default solution for Oracle Applications - EBS and other Oracle Products such as Oracle Portal, WebCenter, Discover, Oracle BI - OBIEE. Integrating Oracle Access Manager and Tivoli Access Manager would be a big challenge. SSOgen would solve this integration.

Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2

IBM Tivoli SSO can be enabled for Oracle EBS - Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2. Oracle EBS integrations such as OBIEE, Hyperion/EPM Suite, ADF Applications, WebCenter, Agile would also be seamlessly SSO Integrated with IBM Tivoli.

Other Oracle Products such as Peoplesoft, Siebel, and JD Edwards can be SSO enabled with IBM Tivoli through SSOgen Gateway

OAM and OID are not necessary

With SSOGEN Gateway Solution, Oracle Access Manager - OAM and Oracle Internet Directory - OID are not required for IBM Tivoli and Oracle Integrations.
