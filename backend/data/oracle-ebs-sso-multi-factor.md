Oracle EBS - Multi Factor Authentication - MFA SSO Integration

Enable MFA SSO with Oracle EBS

Multi-factor Authentication - MFA can be enabled for Oracle e-Business Suite - EBS Authentication. A typical multi-factor authentication is using the SSO password and a token such as RSA token, in this case token acts as a second factor, and this is also known as a two factor authentication. SSOGen would enforce multi-factor authentication by talking to both LDAP Server and Token Validation Server. Oracle EBS would be configured to talk to SSOGen. When a user logs in to EBS, user is redirected to SSOGen, which enforces both password and token validations, and the user is sent back to Oracle EBS Home Page, upon a successful login.

SSOGEN is compatible with hardware tokens such as RSA Tokens, and soft tokens such as Duo. However, these options would be expensive for the customers. SSOGEN offers a free soft token with an app on smart phones(both iOS and Android). Multi-factor Authentication - MFA is free with SSOGEN.

Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2

Multi-Factor Authentication can be enabled for Oracle EBS - Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2. Oracle EBS integrations such as OBIEE, Hyperion/EPM Suite, ADF Applications, WebCenter, Agile would also be seamlessly SSO Integrated with MFA.

Other Oracle Products such as Peoplesoft, Siebel, and JD Edwards can be SSO enabled with Multi-Factor Authentication through SSOgen Gateway

OAM and OID are not necessary
