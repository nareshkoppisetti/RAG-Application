Oracle EBS - RADIUS Authentication for Single Sign On - SSO

Oracle EBS SSO and RADIUS Authentication Integration

Oracle EBS can be now integrated with RADIUS Server for authentication. SSOGEN would be registered as a client to RADIUS Server and Oracle EBS would be configured to delegate the authentication to SSOgen. When a user logs in to EBS, user is redirected to SSOgen, which authenticates the user with RADIUS Server. Upon a successful authentication, User is sent back to Oracle EBS Home Page.

The following RADIUS Server Authentication can be enabled for Oracle Applications 11i, R12, and R12.2:

Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2

Radius Authentication can be enabled for Oracle EBS - Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2. Oracle EBS integrations such as OBIEE, Hyperion/EPM Suite, ADF Applications, WebCenter, Agile would also be seamlessly SSO Integrated with Radius Authentication.

Other Oracle Products such as Peoplesoft, Siebel, and JD Edwards can be SSO enabled with Radius Authentication through SSOgen Gateway

OAM and OID are not necessary

With SSOGEN Gateway Solution, Oracle Access Manager - OAM and Oracle Internet Directory - OID are not required for Radius Authentication and Oracle Integrations.
