Oracle EBS SSO with Microsoft ADFS

Oracle EBS SSO with Microsoft ADFS

Oracle e-Business Suite - EBS can be integrated with Microsoft Active Directory Federated Services - ADFS Services, which are deployed on on-premise servers or in Microsoft Azure - Azure ADFS SSP SSOGen would act as a gateway between Microsoft ADFS services and Oracle EBS. SSOGEN would be registered as a Relying Party in ADFS and Oracle EBS would be configured to talk to SSOGen. When a user logs in to EBS, user is redirected to SSOgen, which in turn sends the user to ADFS Authentication. ADFS would either do Kerberos/Windows Native Authentication or form based login based on its configuration. Upon a successful authentication, User is sent back to Oracle EBS Home Page.

Oracle Access Manager - OAM and OID is the default solution for Oracle EBS (also known as Oracle Applications), and other Oracle Products such as Oracle Portal, WebCenter, Discover, and Oracle BI - OBIEE. However, if your organization has got Microsoft ADFS as the strategic SSO solution, then you would to enable ADFS SSO for Oracle products as well. SSOgen offers a simplified and flexible solution for this gap. SSOGEN would act as a gateway between Microsoft ADFS and Oracle EBS - Oracle Applications to complete the SSO Login Process.

The end user experience would be similar to that of another ADFS SSO protected Application. SSOgen is completely transparent during the login process in this case.

Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2

Microsoft ADFS SSO can be enabled for Oracle EBS - Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2. Oracle EBS integrations such as OBIEE, Hyperion/EPM Suite, ADF Applications, WebCenter, Agile would also be seamlessly SSO Integrated with ADFS.

Other Oracle Products such as Peoplesoft, Siebel, and JD Edwards can be SSO enabled with Microsoft ADFS through SSOgen Gateway

OAM and OID are not necessary

With SSOGEN Gateway Solution, Oracle Access Manager - OAM and Oracle Internet Directory - OID are not required for ADFS and Oracle Integrations.
