Oracle EBS and Kerberos - Windows Native Authentication Integration

Kerberos Authentication can now be enabled for Oracle EBS with SSOGEN SSO Solution. Kerberos authentication is also known as Windows Native Authentication - WNA, Integrated Windows Authentication - IWA, Zero Sign-In SSO, Zero Touch SSO, SPNEGO, and Desktop Authentication. When Kerberos is enabled in the browser, a user can login to EBS with Zero Sign-On, i.e, EBS Login happens automatically (User doesn’t get a login challenge. Kerberos reads Windows Network Login in the Domain to read the user token. Keberos is enabled in Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari Browsers in both Windows and Mac OS.

If your IT Security team does not allow Zero Sign-in Process in to EBS, you may want to use a company branded SSO Login Form with Network / Active Directory (AD) Credentials to Oracle e-Business Suite. For external users, a form based authentication would be configured, while internal, domain users use Kerberos Authentication.

Oracle Access Manager (OAM), Oracle Internet Directory (OID), and Oracle Unified Directory (OUD) are not required for the Keberos Authentication.

The end user experience would be similar to that of other applications that are configured to use Kerberos Authentication. SSOgen is completely transparent during the login process in this case.

Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2

Kerberos Authentication would be enabled for Oracle EBS - Oracle APPS 11i, R12, and R12.2. Oracle EBS integrations such as OBIEE, Hyperion/EPM Suite, ADF Applications, WebCenter, Agile would also be seamlessly SSO Integrated with Windows Native Authentication.

Other Oracle Products such as Peoplesoft, Siebel, and JD Edwards can be SSO enabled with Windows Native Authentication through SSOgen Gateway.

OAM and OID are not necessary

With SSOGEN Gateway Solution, Oracle Access Manager - OAM and Oracle Internet Directory - OID are not required for Windows Native Authentication and Oracle Integrations.
